    <p>The second big project we did in our lab was the tourism website. I was instructed to work with two other students to collaborate on a travel information website. Each one of us picked a country to work on according to a Google Form we filled out, and then compiled all of our information into one website. Our website consisted of the history, traditions, and transportation methods/costs for each student's country. We utilized the same programs as the previous project, minus Lucidchart. 
        <br><br>
        Since this was my first major partner project in the class, I was very nervous the entire time. While it is better than it once was a couple of years ago, my ability to easily speak to other people is not very strong. I very heavily lacked on communicating my problems to my two partners and it proved to be costly. I unnecessarily stressed myself out every step of the way. However, the actual presentation part of this project was extremely helpful to me. Since we were required to present multiple times, I was able to work on my ability to cleanly deliver my words. Since then, that skill has faded, but it was nice while it lasted.
        <br><br>
        A challenge that I had faced during this project was having to try and use a live sharing extension to collaborate with my partners in real time. This had a lot of flaws because the extension had limited what the individuals who were not hosting the live share could do. For example, a big part of working out the nooks and crannies of a website is being able to test it as you work, but the live share had limited that ability to only one person (the host). A challenge I faced alone was the lack of confidence I had in my programming. I had believed that I was not good enough to take on one of these projects, but reminding myself that I had only been coding websites for less than a year helped push me through that barrier. 
        <br><br>
        A CART “Habit of Mind” that I applied to this project was “persist”. By persisting and working through all of my insecurities or hardships regarding the programs we used, I was able to finish and feel somewhat decent about what I had created. And, although this was not used as well as I wish it was, I also used “communicate”. Looking back, the few times that I had spoken up about something, I was not met with the angry or dull comments I expected to receive. My partners were willing to listen to what I had to say, as I was willing to listen to them.
