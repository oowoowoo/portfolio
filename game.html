    <p>The third project of this lab featured a partnered assignment once again, but with only one person. This time, we were required to create an interactive story game through means of HTML, CSS, and mostly JavaScript. My partner and I worked together in order to create a story, two flowcharts, and the code. As well as everything listed, I also included graphics to depict certain milestones within the game. These pieces of artwork were created with a digital art program, FireAlpaca.
        <br><br>
        During this project, I learned a lot about how to write a story. In the past, I had never utilized a plan known as the 12 steps of a hero’s journey. Although our story did not follow it exactly, I believe it was a very interesting experience trying to incorporate it regardless. Besides learning to write better stories, I also learned how to code better functions using JavaScript. By studying multiple previous students’ code, my partner and I were able to piece together a function that would work with our code flawlessly. 
        <br><br>
        The challenges I faced during this project were not few, but I fear I would turn away any reader if I attempted to list them all here. The most prevalent problem to myself is the stress of a deadline I constantly felt. Since I had never written a larger-scale story so quickly while still needing to be thorough, I was wary about actually finishing the project milestones in time to show them to our instructor. However, this stress did pay off because I was able to present each milestone with a finished product (or somewhat finished, depending on what the requirement that week was). In a way, the pressure of being on a time limit actually helped to push me to finish what needed to be done. 
        <br><br>
        The CART “Habit of Mind” I mainly applied to this project was “collaborate”. Seeing as I had to build a storyline, flowchart, working code, and etc. with my partner, collaborating was a massive part of the project. After my previous trouble with communication on my tourism project, I decided to be more confident this time. In the end, my determination to succeed greatly benefitted me as we were able to create a decent game.
