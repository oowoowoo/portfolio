    <h2 class="purple2">Indecision</h2>
    <p>"Hm." I let out a short hum as I'm reminded once again that I am horrible at making
        decisions. <br><br>
        One writing assignment has somehow led to me being indecisive since the day it was
        given to me. I think of one topic and then another, and I'm not able to choose which to write
        about. The effects of COVID-19 on myself, or the fact that I haven't been able to sleep properly
        for most of my life? Both seem like terrible ideas.<br><br>
        "So troubling." My fingers dance along my keys, but no pressure is applied. My mind is
        now empty.<br><br>
        It's either a million thoughts at once or none at all, sometimes it's a horrible mixture that
        is almost painful. A blank mind somehow running at five miles a minute. Today seems to be that
        mix. I can't even come to recall a time in my life where I've had a problem or come to a
        realization, even though I've had thousands of both.<br><br>
        The moment I'm given a prompt my mind runs empty, "typical."<br><br>
        I decided to get up and stretch for the twentieth time that hour, grabbing at my door frame
        and letting my body hang. It's relaxing, but only for a second. For that second, everything slows
        down, but almost instantly it all comes crashing back down.<br><br>
        "It's such an easy assignment, too, Alina." Now I'm in my bathroom talking to myself.
        Sometimes it helps, most of the time it doesn't. I stare at myself for a few minutes and head back
        to my room.<br><br>
        "Come on, you got this." I smile to myself as I find that one bit of motivation and cling
        onto it. Maybe if I just start writing without thinking I'll come up with something.
        But, just like every other time, the motivation disappeared as soon as I sat back down at
        my computer. It gets me thinking about my environment, the noises around me, my posture--
        everything that has to do with an acceptable writing space. No matter how many problems I fix,
        though, nothing seems to change.<br><br>
        "This is why your area of expertise is math, Alina." I groan as I relax my hands onto the
        keyboard, seemingly accepting my defeat. However, that defeat was short-lived. One glance at
        the time and another at the due date of the assignment was the final push. I had one hour left to
        do my work before I had to go to bed.<br><br>
        Just like magic, my fingers started to move. I felt powerful. Typing quickly, my essay was
        done in minutes. It was like an angel had taken over my body for that time and wrote my
        assignment for me. "Maybe I really do work well under pressure. That's lame."<br><br>
        I submit the essay and lay down in my bed, letting out a relieved sigh. Once again, and
        just by a hair, I was able to solve my problem. Of course, I'll come into contact with my
        indecisiveness again in the future, but for now I am just able to hold it as a memory of the past.<br><br>
        "Good job, me."</p>

    <h2 class="purple2">Sunday Morning</h2>
    <p>As a motor now wakes me from my sleep<br>
        Mockingbirds sing until the end of day<br>
        From a neighbor's car I can hear a beep<br>
        It is another morning on Sunday<br><br>
        There's a smell in the air I desire<br>
        And a feel from the sun that warms my heart<br>
        A nice crisp feel in place of smog and fire<br>
        The feeling of Sunday seems to be art<br><br>
        The puffiness of my eyes starts to fade<br>
        And the smell of breakfast wafts in my room<br>
        As soon as my bed was finally made<br>
        I left to the kitchen to now consume<br><br>
        My mother's pancakes were so delicious<br>
        But the creeping feel of Monday, vicious</p>
