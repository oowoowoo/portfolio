    <h3>Indecision</h3>
    <p>"Hm." I let out a short hum as I'm reminded once again that I am horrible at making
        decisions.
        One writing assignment has somehow led to me being indecisive since the day it was
        given to me. I think of one topic and then another, and I'm not able to choose which to write
        about. The effects of COVID-19 on myself, or the fact that I haven't been able to sleep properly
        for most of my life? Both seem like terrible ideas.
        "So troubling." My fingers dance along my keys, but no pressure is applied. My mind is
        now empty.
        It's either a million thoughts at once or none at all, sometimes it's a horrible mixture that
        is almost painful. A blank mind somehow running at five miles a minute. Today seems to be that
        mix. I can't even come to recall a time in my life where I've had a problem or come to a
        realization, even though I've had thousands of both.
        The moment I'm given a prompt my mind runs empty, "typical."
        I decided to get up and stretch for the twentieth time that hour, grabbing at my door frame
        and letting my body hang. It's relaxing, but only for a second. For that second, everything slows
        down, but almost instantly it all comes crashing back down.
        Ennes 2
        "It's such an easy assignment, too, Alina." Now I'm in my bathroom talking to myself.
        Sometimes it helps, most of the time it doesn't. I stare at myself for a few minutes and head back
        to my room.
        "Come on, you got this." I smile to myself as I find that one bit of motivation and cling
        onto it. Maybe if I just start writing without thinking I'll come up with something.
        But, just like every other time, the motivation disappeared as soon as I sat back down at
        my computer. It gets me thinking about my environment, the noises around me, my posture--
        everything that has to do with an acceptable writing space. No matter how many problems I fix,
        though, nothing seems to change.
        "This is why your area of expertise is math, Alina." I groan as I relax my hands onto the
        keyboard, seemingly accepting my defeat. However, that defeat was short-lived. One glance at
        the time and another at the due date of the assignment was the final push. I had one hour left to
        do my work before I had to go to bed.
        Just like magic, my fingers started to move. I felt powerful. Typing quickly, my essay was
        done in minutes. It was like an angel had taken over my body for that time and wrote my
        assignment for me. "Maybe I really do work well under pressure. That's lame."
        I submit the essay and lay down in my bed, letting out a relieved sigh. Once again, and
        just by a hair, I was able to solve my problem. Of course, I'll come into contact with my
        indecisiveness again in the future, but for now I am just able to hold it as a memory of the past.
        "Good job, me."</p>

    <h3>Sunday Morning</h3>
    <p>As a motor now wakes me from my sleep<br>
        Mockingbirds sing until the end of day<br>
        From a neighbor's car I can hear a beep<br>
        It is another morning on Sunday<br><br>
        There's a smell in the air I desire<br>
        And a feel from the sun that warms my heart<br>
        A nice crisp feel in place of smog and fire<br>
        The feeling of Sunday seems to be art<br><br>
        The puffiness of my eyes starts to fade<br>
        And the smell of breakfast wafts in my room<br>
        As soon as my bed was finally made<br>
        I left to the kitchen to now consume<br><br>
        My mother's pancakes were so delicious<br>
        But the creeping feel of Monday, vicious</p>
