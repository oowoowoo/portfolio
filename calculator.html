    <p>Although my lab’s calculator project was not a very big deal in regards to project importance, I am still proud of the work I was able to accomplish with it. Initially, we were only required to create a working calculator through prompt and alert methods. This works, but prompts are not a favored means of collecting data within a website. In the second part of the project, we were instructed to modify our previous functions to make them work with a button and text fields. After a lot of referencing and overall struggles, I managed to make it work.
        <br><br>
        Since this was around the time our lab had begun to mess with JavaScript, I didn’t have much prior experience with it. I learned a lot about being able to construct functions that actually serve a purpose, as well as how to ask my peers for help. At the time, I was sitting by a couple of my friends who I could consult for assistance on code. Being introduced to functions in such a hands-on way was extremely effective in helping me actually understand the material and retain that knowledge. 
        <br><br>
        The biggest challenge I faced with this assignment was the second part, where our code had to be changed to apply to the buttons and text fields. In the end it was a simple change, but at the time I did not know how to apply any of the JavaScript skills we had been practicing to an actual piece of code. My biggest success was actually being able to find the solution on my own, albeit with minor support from the instructor and my peers. 
        <br><br>
        The CART “Habit of Mind” that was applied to this project the most was “persist”. Without persistence, I don’t think I would have tried as hard as I did to understand the material presented to me. Because I was so driven to succeed, I did.
