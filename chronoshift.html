    <p>The first real coding assignment we were given in the year was our Chronoshift Expeditions website project.  This project was given to us because of the story we had been reading during our English portion of the class, “A Sound of Thunder” by Ray Bradbury. We were told to make a website based on the time travel company featured in the story. To create it, I used multiple programs, namely Lucidchart, Figma, and Visual Studio Code. 
        <br><br>
        While using these softwares, I was able to learn more about proper website design and what not to do when designing one. Visual Studio Code is where I learned the most in regards to what I really remember. Our CSS requirements of the project told us to use flexbox, which was an entirely foreign concept to me. Although the flexbox elements used on the website are not perfect, I was able to experiment with it a lot and begin to understand what it does. 
        <br><br>
        The biggest challenge I faced during this project was getting myself to work. For the first time in years I was forced to squeeze inspiration out of myself, which proved to be extremely challenging. I have since changed these habits of mine, but the beginning of the year showed me how stubborn I truly was. Maybe it was because I was just coming out of a year of being at home, but my work ethic was atrocious. The biggest success I had was being able to turn the project in. Like I said before, I had a poor work ethic at this time, so the fact that I had an assignment to turn in at all was a very impressive accomplishment. 
        <br><br>
        The CART “Habits of Mind” that I was able to apply to this project was “persist”. Although my entire body kept fighting me to actually work on the assignment (meaning I physically could not make myself work), I was able to persevere and finish. Another “Habit of Mind” I applied was “collaborate”. Around the middle of this project, I began to speak to some of my classmates and found that I was often not alone in my struggles. Some of the things they suggested had saved my entire project from ruins, as did some of my advice to theirs.
