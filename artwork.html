    <h2>Artwork</h2>

    <p>Both of these pieces are featured in my interactive story game, The Door. If you do not wish to view these out of fear of getting the game spoiled, please navigate to the projects section of
        my website and play the game there. If you do not care, then please continue scrolling.

    <p>This artwork features two of the main characters from The Door being curious about each other. Rosebud, the pink alien in the doorframe, is peering at Albert at his desk.
        Featuring this work in the game helped to set up the curiosity that each character showed toward each other.</p>
