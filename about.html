    <h2>Who is Alina Ennes?</h2>
        <img src="img/crying.jpg" alt=""> 
            <p>My name is Alina Ennes and I am a junior in high school who loves to make video games, but typically hates playing them. 
            I am currently taking the Web Application Development lab at the Center of Advanced Research and Technology, and am going into Interactive Game Design next year.
            Many of my hobbies include drawing, listening to ASMR (like, seriously, hours of it everyday), and writing countless stories and worlds. 
            I love to play God by making my own people with only my mind, which is why I have a passion for creating video games. By someday allowing others to indulge in my games, 
            I will be one step closer to helping people understand how my mind works. Every character I create holds some piece of me, even if itâ€™s a minor detail like the way a 
            piece of hair juts out in one place.</p>
